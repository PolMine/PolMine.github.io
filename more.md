## More about the PolMine-Project

There is an unprecedented availability of digitized, politically relevant texts. Turning text into corpora will stimulate research on old and new questions of political science. Providing the data and the code to make text mining techniques useful for political science is the purpose of the PolMine project.

The project strives to develop repositories of textual data in a sustainable fashion to suit the research needs of political science. Concerning data, the focus is on converting texts produced by public institutions into a sustainable digital format. A digital public archive of democracy is yet to be achieve. Concerning code, PolMine provides a flexible open source infrastruture for working efficiently with large scale corpora. A bulk of data without analytical abilities is of no use.

The PolMine project relies heavily on the statistical programming language R. We believe it is a prudent choice: R is great for interactive data analysis and for data visualisation, particularly when used in combination with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as an [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

R is one of the more accessible programming languages. Writing code yourself means gaining a flexibility to implement ideas and workflows that cannot be attained when being an end-user of a graphical user interface. This comes at a cost: Using R may be a thorny experience at first. As we want to make corpora a useful and productive resource for research, offering tutorials, recipies and how-tos is an integral part of the PolMine Project.

The **'Using Corpora and Social Science Research' (UCSSR)** series of teaching and learning resources shall successively meet the needs of users of polmineR, and corpora such as GermaParl. At this stage, we have a set of [online slides](https://polmine.github.io/UCSSR) available in German. English versions of the slides are being prepared.

The **documentation of the packages** we share is a second important resource to learn how to use the packages. The README files of the packages are the landing pages of a package at GitHub, and are the conventional entry point to learn how a package can be installed and used. For most packages, the package documentation has been rendered into a website hosted at GitHub pages.

Using the **[Corpus Workbench (CWB)](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/)** as a backend for corpus analysis is a fundamental design choice. A thorough understanding of the syntax of the Corpus Query Processor (CQP) may be necessary to make full use of linguistically annotated corpora, but explaining the details of the CQP syntax goes beyond the scope of the documentation of our packages. The [CQP tutorial](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/files/CQP_Tutorial.pdf) is the traditional resource for learning how to use CQP. If you plan to prepare corpora yourself, the [CQP encoding tutorial](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/files/CWB_Encoding_Tutorial.pdf) will include technical explanations that may be very helpful. Another system that uses the CWB as a backend is [CQPweb](http://cwb.sourceforge.net/cqpweb.php). A series of [CQPweb tutorials at You Tube](https://www.youtube.com/user/corpusworkbench) conveys many valuable insights how CQP can be used.

Then there is R itself. There are various resources you can use to learn R, such as [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/). But using R productively will involve more than just learning to write R code.

  - First, as mentioned initially, using **[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)** makes using R much more comfortable than working with R at the command line. 
  - Second, for doing analyses, writing **[Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)** documents is a great approach. Rmarkdown offers the opportunity to combine code and text, and are a good way to realize the ideas of literate programming and reproducible research.
  - Third, our code is under version control and we recommend to start using **[git](https://git-scm.com/)** as a version control system early on, particularly when you work in a collaborative setting.

Finally, a resource we would like to mention is **[R bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)**. There is always a wealth of fresh ideas the blogs convey!

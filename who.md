The PolMine Project is an initiative of [Andreas Blätte, Professor of Public Policy and Regional Politics](http://www.andreas-blaette.de). The members of the PolMine Research Group contribute to the project either by contributing code and data, disseminating or contributing to the project in a collaborative setting.

  - Andreas Blaette (Head of the PolMine Research Group)
  - Simon Gehlhar (Research Assistant, MIDEM Project)
  - Christoph Leonhardt (Research Assistant, MigTex Project)
  - Merve Schmitz-Vardar (Research Assistant, MigTex Project)

PolMine is affiliated with the [NRW School of Governance](http://www.nrwschool.de) at the [Institute of Political Science](https://www.uni-due.de/politik/) ([Department of the Social Sciences](https://www.uni-due.de/gesellschaftswissenschaften/), [University of Duisburg-Essen](http://www.uni-due.de)). A **special thanks** goes to the IT of the Department of Social Sciences. We are grateful for the outstanding and unfailing support of Anita Born and Florian Böhm!

<p>The PolMine Project could not evolve without being part of collaborative networks and a family of related projects. Most importantly, PolMine is a registered category-C centre in the European CLARIN network. The GermaParl corpus is part of the resource family of parliamentary corpora of CLARIN. We have contributed actively to the ParlCLARIN workshops at Sofia (2017) and at the LREC conference in Miyazaki, Japan (2018).</p>

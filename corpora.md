**Public data:** The focus of PolMine is on the texts published by public institutions. Corpora of parliamentary protocols remain at the heart of the project.

**Sustainability:** To facilitate the growth of sustainable corpora, we are also concerned to develop a solid codebase that will ensure the reproducibility and expansion of the corpora on a continuous basis.

**Standardization:** We adhere to standardizations suggested by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). An XML document conforming to TEI is sufficiently flexible to be turned into almost any other data format required.

**Ensuring quality:** Released corpora are available for registered academic users. We want to involve users in a process to improve the quality of the data.

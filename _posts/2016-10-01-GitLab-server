To prepare the registration of the PolMine Project as a CLARIN centre, we have set up a GitLab server that we 
will use to host resources emanating from the PolMine project. The focus of the project is on parliamentary protocols,
the first resource we make available was developed in the project "Plenarprotokolle als öffentliche Sprachressource
der Demokratie" (funded by the BMBF). The data are accessible via git repositories for registered academic users - please
get in touch to get access. The advantage of the choice for a git repository with the data is, as we see it, the ability 
to version the data, and to use the issue tracker of GitLab for quality ensurance.

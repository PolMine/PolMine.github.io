The PolMine Project is now a registered CLARIN centre, i.e. it is listed [here](https://www.clarin.eu/content/overview-clarin-centres).
As a category C CLARIN centre, we offer metadata for the data resulting from the PolMine project that can be harvested by a web service.
Most importantly, our data can now be explored through the Virtual Language Observatory (VLO). The data itself is available for registered 
academic users through our GitLab server (gitlab.sowi.uni-due.de).

Finally, the polmineR-package is available as an officially registered R package <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=polmineR">(here)</a>.
The package can now be installed with the install.packages-mechanism from R. The development version of the polmineR-package will be available
at GitHub. That's also where we offer a tutorial to install polmineR and all necessary dependencies.

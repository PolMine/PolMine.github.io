Installing the polmineR-package can be an awkward experience - but you can also get it done in less than five minutes. To support users who want to install and use the polmineR package, we offer two video tutorials at YouTube - one for [Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn6ycr8b248), and one for [Mac OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmctDeRBKk). (Sorry - due to the rcqp dependency, we cannot yet offer an installation option on Windows machines, apart from virtual machines). A great thanks goes to Simon Gehlhar for preparing the tutorials!

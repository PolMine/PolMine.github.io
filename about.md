There is an unprecedented availability of digitized, politically relevant texts. Turning text into corpora will stimulate research on old and new questions of political science. Providing the data and the code to make text mining techniques useful for political science is the purpose of the PolMine project.

The project strives to develop repositories of textual data in a sustainable fashion to suit the research needs of political science. Concerning data, the focus is on converting text issued by public institutions into a sustainable digital format (TEI/XML). Releases of PolMine data are available through a GitLab server (gitlab.sowi.uni-due.de). At GitHub, PolMine offers a set of R packages to prepare corpora (ctk package and extensions) and to perform corpus analysis and text mining (polmineR package and extensions).

PolMine is a project of the Professorship of Public Policy and Regional Politics (Prof. Dr. Andreas Bl√§tte) affiliated with the NRW School of Governance and the Institute of Political Science (Department of the Social Sciences | University of Duisburg-Essen).

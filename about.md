The PolMine Project is about developing code to make text mining techniques productive for political science research. Methodologically, the guiding idea is that striving for valid research findings requires the capacity to combine qualitative and quantitative steps seamlessly in an interactive workflow. We try to deal with text as linguistic data. These ideas are implemented using the statistical programming language R. The R package polmineR is the core for doing text analyses and is complemented by packages for corpus preparation.

Concerning research data management, the thrust of the PolMine Project is to turn texts issued by public institutions into a language resources for research. Corpora of parliamentary protocols remain at the heart of the project. We offer GermaParl, a corpus of the plenary protocols of the German Bundestag. We strive for a *sustainable research data management* that includes a *fully reproducible data preparation* workflow, working towards *standardized, [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/)-compatible data formats*, and *involving users for quality management*.

Whether you call it computer-assisted content analysis, text mining, computational social science, or digital humanities: There are new techniques and methodologies to acquire when dealing with text as linguistic data. Code and data need the company of teaching and and learning resources, if we want new digital technologies to become a part of our research in the digital age. The 'Using Corpora in Social Science Research (UCSSR)'-Series, a set of slides at this stage, offer tutorials for working with polmineR and linguistically annotated corpora.

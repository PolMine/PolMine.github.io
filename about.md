PolMine is a project of the Professorship of Public Policy and Regional Politics ([Prof. Dr. Andreas Bl√§tte](http://www.andreas-blaette.de)). It is affiliated with the [NRW School of Governance](http://www.nrwschool.de) and the [Institute of Political Science](https://www.uni-due.de/politik/) ([Department of the Social Sciences](https://www.uni-due.de/gesellschaftswissenschaften/), [University of Duisburg-Essen](http://www.uni-due.de)). The PolMine Project is about developing code and data. The project strives to contribute to making the unprecedented availability of digitized, politically relevant text a useful resource for social science research. 

Developing code to make text mining techniques useful for political science is a first objective of the PolMine project. Methodologically, the guiding idea is that striving for valid research findings requires an ability to combine qualitative and quantitative steps seamlessly in an interactive workflow. We try to deal with text as linguistic data. These ideas are implemented using the statistical programming language R.

As far as data management is concerned, the objective of the PolMine Project is to turn texts issued by public institutions into a useful language resource for social science research. Corpora of parliamentary protocols have been, and remain at the heart of the project. Pursuing a *sustainable research data management* that includes a *fully reproducible data preparation* workflow, working with *standardized data formats* (following the guidelines of the [Text Encoding Initiative / TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/), and *involving users for quality management* purposes are ideas the PolMine Project wants to establish.
